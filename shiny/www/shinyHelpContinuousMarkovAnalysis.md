### Discrete Markov Analysis

**Usage** 

This tab is used for discrete Markov chain analysis. This means that the patients stay in a state for a fixed amount of time. In this tab we will define the discrete Markov chain analysis and retrieve a transformation matrix as well as some cost statistics from the raw data pulled from Atlas. The data used should be generated with **Cohort2Trajectory** package.

**Analysing**

**Intensity matrix**
Intensity matrix for trajectories.

**Sojourn time**
Statistics about the mean time patient stays in the respective state.

**Transition matrix**
Insert the transition time in years. For example 1 day is 0.00273785 of 1 year.
After pressing **Calculate!** button the calculated transition matrix is shown.
