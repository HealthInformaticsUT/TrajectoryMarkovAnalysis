### Package 'TrajectoryMarkovAnalysis':  Package for creating Markov models for patient-orientated trajectories

**Development Status: Under Development**

### Information

This shiny application aims to help users in using TrajectoryMarkovAnalysis functionalities.
R-package TrajectoryMarkovAnalysis specializes on modelling patient trajectories using Markov chains. The package supports discrete and continuous time Markov models, Kaplan-Meier plots, Markov trees and synthetic data generation. The package is based on OMOP CDM. The inputs for this package should be generateb by the Cohort2Trajectory package.
