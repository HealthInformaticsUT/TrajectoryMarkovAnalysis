### Discrete Markov Analysis

**Usage** 

This tab is used for discrete Markov chain analysis. This means that the patients stay in a state for a fixed amount of time. In this tab we will define the discrete Markov chain analysis and retrieve a transformation matrix as well as some cost statistics from the raw data pulled from Atlas. The data used should be generated with **Cohort2Trajectory** package.

**Analysing**

Treshold (matrix visualisation): Just a value of importance for highlighting some state transfers in the transformation matrix.

After filling in the options, hit the Analyze button to run the workflow.

**Stochastic transitions**
Transition matrix retrieved from observed data.

**Trajectory start statistics**
Statistics about the entry level states for patients.

**State statistics**
Statistics about each state.
