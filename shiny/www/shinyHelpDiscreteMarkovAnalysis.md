### Discrete Markov Analysis

**Usage** 

This tab is used for discrete Markov chain analysis. This means that the patients stay in a state for a fixed amount of time. In this tab we will define the discrete Markov chain analysis and retrieve a transformation matrix as well as some cost statistics from the raw data pulled from ATLAS. The input data used should be generated with **Cohort2Trajectory** package.

**Select the cost domains included in analysis:** Select the cost domains you want to have included in cost analysis. 
**Select the states you want to exclude from analysis:** You can exclude some states from analysis. 

**Stochastic transitions**
Transition matrix retrieved from observed data.

**Trajectory start statistics**
Statistics about the entry level states for patients.

**State statistics**
Statistics about each state.
